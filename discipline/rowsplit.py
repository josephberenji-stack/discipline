rowsplit.py -- a kill-check reports the rows that violate, and a witness.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  attention.py #63: a determination test passed on zero
examinations because the keys it compared never collided.  definitions.py
#28: a row filter hid the thirteen-row flat run that was the evidence.
transport.py #70: a surjectivity check compared a set with itself.  In every
case a count was printed and the count was believable.

TWO HALVES.

  1. An API for scripts.  killcheck(name, rows, violates, key=...) prints the
     violating rows (up to `show`), the first witness, the number examined,
     and REFUSES to report "0 violations" when 0 rows were examined -- that
     is the #63 case, and it prints VACUOUS instead of PASS.

  2. A linter.  For each print() whose text matches "N of M" / "0 of" /
     "violations" / "failures" with no neighbouring print of a row or a
     witness within `window` lines, a row is reported: a count with nothing
     beside it.  This is a heuristic; it produces rows for a human, not a
     verdict.

Rows, not counts.
