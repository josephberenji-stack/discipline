"""forced.py -- was the outcome ever at risk?  The static half.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  referee.py refuses a verdict whose argument is a literal, and
audit.py mutates the construction to see whether a claim can move.  Between the
two there is a gap: an argument that is computed by the letter but whose value
was written into the file -- an expected-answer table compared against itself, a
threshold that is the answer, a name that traces back through two assignments to
a constant.  This walks the syntax and prints those as rows.

KILL-CHECK, declared before any run.  What refutes a file's empirical standing is
a row here: a verdict argument that traces back only to constants, or a constant
container standing on one side of a comparison whose other side is computed.  A
grid of INPUTS is not a row -- a constant that is only ever iterated over is a
parameter, and parameters are allowed to be written down.  The distinction the
checker makes is iterated (input) against compared (expected output).

A second distinction the checker makes is declared against undeclared.  A
prediction has to be written down somewhere -- "the Betti row is (1, 2, 1)" is
the prediction, and comparing a computed row against it is what a prediction is
for.  So a constant that also appears in the file's declare() text is the
declared prediction and is not a row.  A constant that appears only in the
comparison is an expectation the file never committed to in advance, and is.
Membership tests (in / not in) are filters, not comparisons against an answer,
and are not rows either.  Neither is an all-zero container OUTSIDE a
claim-deciding test: a comparison against the zero vector is an identity check,
not an expected value.  Inside a claim-deciding test it stays a row, because
"the map is zero" is a claim like any other and has to be declared.

WHAT IT CHECKS.
  A  verdict/control called with a constant second argument       (static)
  B  a constant container of 2 or more entries in a comparison whose
     value is NOT named in the file's own declare() text            (answer table)
  C  a verdict argument whose free names all trace back, through
     assignments, to constants and nothing else                   (traced)
  E  a control() call with no `vacuous=` argument.  A control that agrees
     with the claim on some of its rows is silent on them, not failing, and
     the referee sees only pass or fail.  The count cannot be derived from the
     syntax, so the file has to state it; not stating it is the row (#151).
  D  a comparison against an undeclared numeric literal in a test that
     decides a claim -- either inside the reported argument itself, or
     in an if whose body records a violating row for that claim.  An
     A literal is a row unless it is 0, 1 or 2 -- structural (empty,
     singleton, pair) -- whether it is spelt 2 or 2.0.  Every other
     value, integer or float, is a chosen one.  A declared FRACTION
     declares the float it equals: "theta = 1/2" declares 0.5, by exact
     arithmetic and no tolerance.
     A number used to truncate a printed line is not a row.        (threshold)

LEDGER.
  #151 (found by Joseph, 8 Sep, on his own control in IDEA-014 f3: "control k.n
    is worse than it looks, because at n = 1 it equals the claim, so 15 of its
    rows are vacuous by construction -- my error, same shape as the gauge-ctrl
    problem").  #137(a) was a control whose outcome was forced by the code that
    computed it; this is a control whose outcome is forced on part of its grid
    by arithmetic.  Both are invisible to a referee that sees only pass or fail.
    referee.control() takes a vacuous= count now and prints NOT MEASURED when it
    is absent; check E here makes the absence a row.
  #140 (found by Joseph, 8 Sep, asking whether the space is EMPIRICALLY COMPUTABLE
    -- "takes actual values everywhere a value is needed").  Check D read
    `isinstance(s.value, int)` and floats are not ints, so every float threshold in
    the space was invisible to it: 0.5 and 0.95 in IDEA-005-scaling-2.py, and 0.25,
    0.3, 0.7, 1.3, 1.7, 2.3 in IDEA-009-transengine-1.py, eight windows deciding
    verdicts that this check could not see.  All eight are declared in their files'
    docstrings, so the space reports no new row -- the defect was in the CHECK's
    reach, not in the files, and it cost nothing only by luck.  D now reads floats
    with no magnitude floor.  Two consequences, both computed rather than assumed:
    a float that equals 0, 1 or 2 takes the same structural exemption its integer
    spelling takes (IDEA-006-direction-1.py:196 compares a normalisation against
    1.0); and a declared fraction declares the float it equals, since
    IDEA-006-direction-1.py writes 0.5 in the code and 1/2 in the declaration and
    those are one number.

Rows, not counts.
