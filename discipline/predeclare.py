"""
predeclare.py -- a script that prints a verdict carries a prediction above it.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  A model reinterprets a number after the fact.  The only
defence the project found is to have the failure condition on disk before
the number exists: algebra.py's "DECLARED IN ADVANCE -- what would count as a
failure", thm.py's "PREDICTIONS, WRITTEN BEFORE THE RUN", verify.py's "I
believe it is not and this is the test that says so".

WHAT IT CHECKS.  A file whose source prints a verdict word (HOLDS, FAILS,
CONFIRMED, REFUTED, SURVIVES, PASS/FAIL in a report line) must contain, in
its module docstring or in a print that precedes the first computation
(first for/while/def with a body that prints), one of the declaration
markers: PREDICT, PREDICTION, DECLARED IN ADVANCE, "before the run",
"before computing", "what would count as a failure", "kill", "would
refute".  A file with verdicts and no declaration is a row.

Rows, not counts.
