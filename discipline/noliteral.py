"""
noliteral.py -- no printed table column or verdict may be a constant.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  The rule "where prose and table disagree, the table is right"
presumes the table was computed.  The corpus audit found columns that read as
checks and were literals: variants.py printed lambda as the literal 2.0 in the
table under which RESULTS.md says "lambda never moves"; algebra.py printed
'YES' and 1.0 in columns headed "PM contradiction?" and "CF"; measure.py printed
0.0 in a column headed "retained"; verify.py printed a literal True in a column
that reads as a test.  Each was believed because it was in a table.

WHAT IT CHECKS.  Every f-string that is an argument of print() is walked; each
formatted field whose expression is a constant (number, string, True/False/None,
or a container of constants) is reported as a row with file, line, the literal,
and the format spec.  A verdict string passed to print() that contains a verdict
word (HOLDS, FAILS, PASS, CONFIRMED, REFUTED, ...) with no formatted field at
all is reported separately: a conclusion that does not depend on any variable.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK.  Headers.  A field whose format spec is a plain string
alignment (e.g. {'atoms':>9}) is a column header and is skipped.  A constant
that is explicitly labelled (const) in the surrounding text is skipped.

Rows, not counts.
