"""referee.py -- the runtime half of the referee.  The builder writes the file;
this module refuses the moves the builder is not allowed to make.

WHY.  In the v9 -> v10 sitting four headline verdicts were literals or
identities (values W6, exist X7, derive E1, definable D1), one prediction
failed without the file saying so (selfpres C3), and a withdrawal was printed
below the result it withdrew.  Every one of those is the builder writing the
referee's line.  This module makes those lines un-writable:

  declare(name, predicts=..., kills=..., requires=[...], control=...)
      must precede verdict(name, ...).  A verdict with no declaration is
      refused.  'predicts' and 'kills' are strings the run will be held to;
      'requires' lists existing results by file or theorem number.
  verdict(name, ok, detail)
      'ok' must be an EXPRESSION, not a literal -- the call site is parsed
      and `verdict("X", True, ...)` is refused.  The printed word is chosen
      by the value, never typed.
  control(name, ok)
      a negative control: a case that MUST fail.  ok == True is a failure
      of the file, not a pass.  At least one is required before close().
  rows(name, violating)
      the rows behind a count.  A verdict whose 'ok' came from a count
      should call rows() with the offending items; close() lists sections
      that reported a number and no rows.
  withdraw(name, text)
      prints a withdrawal and refuses to run after a verdict for the same
      name has been printed -- withdrawals go above results.
  close()
      prints the ledger of declarations vs outcomes and exits non-zero when
      any verdict lacked a declaration, no control ran, a control passed,
      or a prediction was contradicted without the file saying so.

Rows, not counts.  Predictions before runs.  The verdict is computed.
